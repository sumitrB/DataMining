# 📊 Data Mining Course Assignments

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks created as part of my Data Mining course. Each notebook tackles a wide range of concepts and techniques in data mining and machine learning, using a unique dataset for exploration and implementation.

## 📁 Notebooks Overview

Each `.ipynb` file is structured around a specific dataset and integrates several of the topics listed below:

### 🧠 Topics Covered

- **Statistical Concepts & Data Weirdness**
- **Similarity Measures**
- **MinHashing & LSH**
- **Data Pre-processing**
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**
- **Linear Regression & Naive Bayes**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Clustering**: 
  - K-Means 
  - Agglomerative Clustering 
  - DBSCAN
- **Classification**:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
- **Ensemble Methods & Boosting**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Recommender Systems**
- **Natural Language Processing (Intro)**
- **Neural Networks (Basics + Bias & Explainability)**

> 🔍 Each notebook is self-contained and blends theory with implementation using Python libraries.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk / spaCy (NLP-related)
- tensorflow / keras (for Neural Networks)
